## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for Spotify analytics using modern data engineering tools and technologies. The pipeline is designed for real-time ingestion and transformation of Spotify streaming data, with the final output being interactive visualizations in Power BI.

## Key functionalities include:

Real-time data ingestion via AWS Lambda and S3.
Data transformation and processing using PySpark.
Orchestration and scheduling through Airflow.
Efficient data loading into Snowflake using Snowpipe.
Data visualization with Power BI dashboards for performance metrics.

## Project Architecture

The architecture of the project involves the following key stages:

Data Ingestion: Spotify data is ingested in real-time through AWS Lambda and stored in AWS S3.
Data Processing: PySpark, running inside Docker containers, processes the raw data.
Data Orchestration: Apache Airflow is used for orchestrating the ETL processes.
Data Loading: Snowpipe automates the loading of processed data into Snowflake.
Data Visualization: Power BI visualizes the data, providing real-time insights into key metrics.

## Technologies Used
AWS Lambda: Real-time data ingestion.
S3: Data storage for raw and transformed data.
Apache Airflow: Pipeline orchestration and scheduling.
PySpark: Data transformation and processing.
Docker: Containerized environment for PySpark.
Snowpipe: Automated data loading into Snowflake.
Snowflake: Cloud data warehouse for scalable storage and analytics.
Power BI: Dashboard creation for data visualization.

## Data Pipeline Components
1. AWS Lambda
Purpose: Handles real-time data ingestion from the Spotify API.
Trigger: Automatically triggered at regular intervals to fetch streaming data.
Output: Stores the raw data in an S3 bucket.

2. S3
Purpose: Serves as the storage layer for raw and processed data.
Raw Data Storage: Ingested data from Spotify is stored here.
Processed Data Storage: Transformed data is saved here before loading into Snowflake.

4. PySpark
Purpose: Processes and transforms the raw Spotify data.
Implementation: PySpark jobs run inside Docker containers, ensuring a scalable and isolated processing environment.

5. Apache Airflow
Purpose: Orchestrates the entire ETL process.
DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph): Airflow DAG manages the flow of tasks from ingestion to transformation and loading.

Tasks:
Trigger AWS Lambda to ingest data.
Process the ingested data using PySpark.
Load the processed data into Snowflake via Snowpipe.

6. Snowpipe
Purpose: Automates the data loading from S3 into Snowflake.
Integration: Snowpipe watches the S3 bucket and loads the new data as soon as it's available.

7. Snowflake
Purpose: Serves as the central data warehouse where the processed data is stored and made available for querying and analysis.

8. Power BI
Purpose: Provides interactive dashboards that visualize the key metrics, allowing stakeholders to gain actionable insights from the Spotify data.

## Data Flow Steps
Data Ingestion: AWS Lambda fetches streaming data from Spotify and saves it to S3.
Data Processing: PySpark processes the raw data, performing transformations such as filtering, aggregation, and format changes.
Data Loading: Snowpipe loads the processed data into Snowflake.
Visualization: Power BI connects to Snowflake to fetch the data and visualize it through dashboards.

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides insights into the following:

Top tracks by streams
Most popular artists
User listening patterns
Stream count by region

## Future Enhancements
Integration with other music platforms for a broader dataset.
Implementation of machine learning models for recommendation systems.
Real-time analytics using AWS Kinesis or Kafka.
